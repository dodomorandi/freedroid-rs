# Freedroid Classic Rust port

This is a Rust port of [Freedroid Classic](https://github.com/ReinhardPrix/FreedroidClassic) engine.

The aim of the project is not to _modernize_ or _replace_ the original engine, but to explore the _oxidation_ process of a C codebase without the help of tools like [C2Rust](https://github.com/immunant/c2rust).
